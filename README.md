# Modeling-of-copper-anode
    A large part of my paper
    This program cotains several files written by matlab and python(maybe).
    .m files are used to optimise material's parameter by comparing load-displacement curve derived from simulation using guessed values with the curve from experiment.
    .py files are used to link abaqus and matlab.
    Hope it works :)
